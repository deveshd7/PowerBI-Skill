# Phase 1 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | None — prompt/skill system, not compiled code |
| **Config file** | none — Wave 0 creates fixture files |
| **Quick run command** | Manual: invoke `/pbi:explain` with a known DAX measure in Claude Code |
| **Full suite command** | Manual: run all five commands with test measures from `tests/fixtures/` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~10 minutes (manual pass) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Manual smoke test — invoke each new skill once with a simple measure to confirm it appears in menu and responds
- **After every plan wave:** Full manual pass with test fixture measures for all five commands
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must pass
- **Max feedback latency:** One wave (no automated timer)

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [x] `tests/fixtures/simple-measure.dax` — `Revenue = SUM(Sales[Amount])` — covers DAX-01, DAX-03 (Simple) — created by plan 01-01 Task 2
- [x] `tests/fixtures/intermediate-measure.dax` — `Sales YTD = CALCULATE([Revenue], DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))` — covers DAX-02, DAX-03 (Intermediate) — created by plan 01-01 Task 2
- [x] `tests/fixtures/complex-measure.dax` — `Risky = SUMX(Customers, [Revenue])` — covers DAX-09 (iterator over measure ref) — created by plan 01-01 Task 2
- [x] `tests/fixtures/slow-filter-measure.dax` — `Slow = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amt]), FILTER(Sales, Sales[Year]=2024))` — covers DAX-08 (Rule 1) — created by plan 01-01 Task 2
- [x] `tests/fixtures/error-log.txt` — sample Power BI error message — covers ERR-01 — created by plan 01-01 Task 2
- [x] `.pbi-context.md` initial stub — created by plan 01-01 Task 1

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Skill appears in `/` command menu | INFRA-01 | Claude Code menu is UI-only | Type `/pbi` in Claude Code; verify `/pbi:explain`, `/pbi:format`, `/pbi:optimise`, `/pbi:comment`, `/pbi:error` all appear |
| Plain-English explanation with context sections | DAX-01, DAX-02 | Natural language output; no structured assertion | Paste test measure; read output; verify filter context, row context, transitions identified |
| Complexity level tag adapts | DAX-03 | Model judgment call | Paste Simple → verify `[Simple]` tag; paste nested SUMX → verify `[Advanced]` tag |
| SQLBI format + code block | DAX-04, DAX-05 | Visual/format check | Paste unformatted measure; verify indentation style matches SQLBI convention |
| API fallback note visible | DAX-06 | Requires breaking the API URL | Break URL in skill; run format; verify graceful fallback with one-line note |
| Iterator-over-measure flagged, not rewritten | DAX-09 | Requires Claude to correctly identify pattern | Paste `SUMX(Customers, [CustomerRevenue])`; verify only a flag is returned, not a rewrite |
| Context file captures prior failures | CTX-02, CTX-04 | Interactive session state | Manually cause a failure; check `.pbi-context.md`; re-run; verify alternative approach led |
| Error correlation to last change | ERR-02 | Requires prior context in session file | Run a command, record it; then paste a related error and verify the output cross-references the prior command |
| Skip failed approach on repeat error | ERR-04 | Requires prior failure in context | Log a failed approach; paste same error; verify output skips the failed method |

## Validation Sign-Off

- [x] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [x] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [x] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [x] No watch-mode flags
- [x] Feedback latency documented (manual cadence accepted for skill-only phase)
- [x] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** approved
