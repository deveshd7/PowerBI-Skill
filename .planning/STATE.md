# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14 after v1.0 milestone)

**Core value:** Never block a data analyst — solve immediately, interrogate only when stuck or asked
**Current focus:** Planning v1.1 Deep Mode (Phase 3)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Deep Mode + Verification)
Plan: 0/TBD — not started
Status: v1.0 shipped — ready to plan Phase 3

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67% (2 of 3 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7 (across v1.0)
- Average duration: ~10 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~70 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-skill-core-escalation | 2 | ~20 min |
| 02-context-aware-dax | 5 | ~6 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Solve-first (progressive friction) over interrogation-first — correct inversion for daily-use co-pilot
- Targeted escalation: one question per identified gap type
- `*` wildcard catch-all in routing: no empty-args bounce for any DAX request
- Step 0.5 placement: after `## Instructions`, before Step 1
- Skip Step 0.5 when `## Model Context` already present in session context
- Duplication check always-on (not opt-in)
- Filter-sensitive keyword list includes natural language phrases (not just DAX function names)
- Measures gate fires only on analyst completion signal (end-of-session review, not per-measure)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Tech debt (v1.0 known gaps — address in v1.1):**
1. pbi-edit writes `Entity:` not `Measure:` to `## Last Command` — breaks pbi-error ERR-02 correlation after edit sessions
2. pbi-diff / pbi-commit omit `Measure:` field — leaves stale value, pbi-error correlates wrong measure
3. pbi-optimise Command History row format: wrong column order (`command | measure | rules | timestamp` vs schema `timestamp | command | measure | outcome`)
