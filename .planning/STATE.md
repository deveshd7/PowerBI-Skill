# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** A BI analyst can drop into `/pbi` at any point in their workflow and get expert-level help — DAX, model auditing, error recovery, version control — without leaving Claude.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Paste-in DAX Commands

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Paste-in DAX Commands)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — Roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Slash command architecture (like GSD): analyst knows exactly what command to reach for; smart routing for bare `/pbi`
- Support both file-edit and paste-in modes: PBIP reload pain point means paste-ready output is often more practical
- v1 focuses on DAX + model layer, not visuals: highest-value pain points are measure quality and model health
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: pbi-load is complete for Phase 1 — informs analysts that PBIP context loading arrives in Phase 2; all placeholder skills use disable-model-invocation: true
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Reasoning skills use model: sonnet; pbi-load uses model: haiku; all use relative .pbi-context.md path for portability
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: tail -80 cap on context injection prevents history bloat in .pbi-context.md bash injection
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Complexity classification inferred from DAX function patterns, not analyst-declared — zero-setup UX preserved
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Read-then-Write enforced for .pbi-context.md updates (not bash append) to prevent malformed state
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Comment rules focus on business logic (why/what) not DAX mechanics — avoids noise from line-by-line syntax translation
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Description Field capped at 300 chars with no markdown and no DAX function names — matches Power BI tooltip display constraints
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: tail -100 used for pbi-error session context injection — error recovery benefits from more history than DAX commands (tail -80)
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Analyst-Reported Failures is analyst-managed only — pbi-error skill does not auto-write to that section to avoid false positives
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Iterator-over-measure-reference is flagged only, never auto-rewritten — context transition semantics must be manually verified before refactoring
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: CRITICAL GUARD (Step 3) is positioned before rule application (Step 4) — order is load-bearing for correctness
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Rationale depth scales with inferred complexity: simple=one sentence, advanced=full paragraph explaining engine-level mechanism
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: DAX Formatter JSON endpoint /api/daxformatter/dax returns 404 — legacy form-POST confirmed working; skill uses legacy endpoint with HTML strip pipeline
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: API_FAIL fallback text locked: '_DAX Formatter API unavailable — formatted inline by Claude_'
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: pbi-load startup uses three bash injections: PBIP detection + file index + session context; PBIP_MODE and PBIP_FORMAT flags drive all branching
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: No-project path outputs locked message and stops; does not mention file mode, does not write .pbi-context.md
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: Read-then-Write single pass: Model Context + Last Command + Command History updated atomically in .pbi-context.md
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: TMDL and TMSL fixtures exercise both add-description and update-description code paths (Revenue YTD has description, Revenue does not)
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: TMSL model.bim uses array expression for Revenue YTD and string for Revenue — write-back must preserve original form to avoid TMSL parse errors
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: Both fixtures include bidirectional relationship — intentionally included for Phase 3 audit rule testing
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: pbi-comment writes without confirm prompt; silent paste-in fallback when no PBIP; TMSL expression preserves original string/array form; tasklist permission error treated as DESKTOP=closed
- [Phase 02-context-detection-and-pbip-file-i-o]: pbi-error confirm-before-write is unique vs pbi-comment silent write; capital N default on confirm prompt; category-gated writes (A/B/C only); manual live testing deferred pending PBI Desktop access
- [Phase 03-model-wide-audit]: dataCategory: Time placed as table-level TMDL property before column blocks — not inside a column block
- [Phase 03-model-wide-audit]: Products.tmdl intentionally isolated (no relationships.tmdl entry) to trigger AUD-03 WARN heuristic for tables with no outbound relationships
- [Phase 03-model-wide-audit]: /pbi:audit is read-only — no Desktop/tasklist check; four domain passes merged then severity-sorted before emit
- [Phase 03-model-wide-audit]: Rule N-04 skipped in Naming domain — display folder handled exclusively by M-03 to avoid duplicate findings
- [Phase 03-model-wide-audit]: /pbi:audit is read-only — four domain passes merged then severity-sorted before single emit; Rule N-04 skipped in Naming to avoid duplicate display-folder findings
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: pbi-diff: silent gitignore auto-fix with glob coverage check prevents duplicate .gitignore entries on repeated runs
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: pbi-diff: git diff scoped to .SemanticModel/ paths only — never unscoped git diff to avoid report/theme file noise
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: pbi-diff: HAS_COMMITS=no fallback uses git status --porcelain instead of git diff HEAD to handle empty repos (Pitfall 1)
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: git push is never executed in pbi-commit bash blocks — push reminder is output text only (GIT-07)
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: pbi-commit git add scoped to '.SemanticModel/' in all three code paths (init, empty repo, normal) — never unscoped git add
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: Nested git repos in test fixtures: fixture .git/ provides runtime git history; parent project repo tracks only content files, not the fixture's .git/
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: Test fixture baseline commit message 'chore: initial PBIP model commit' is the expected string in git log verification; pbip-no-repo has no git init by design — /pbi:commit initialises one during GIT-08 test flow
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: Auto-commit block placed after Written-to confirmation in both TMDL and TMSL paths in pbi-comment; inside y-confirm branch only in pbi-error (n/N path does not trigger it)
- [Phase 04-git-workflow]: AUTO_COMMIT=fail is silent — file write success is primary outcome; git failure is non-fatal; no git push in pbi-comment or pbi-error (GIT-07)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- DAX Formatter API endpoint path is MEDIUM confidence — needs empirical verification with a test `curl` call before wiring into `/pbi:format`. Fallback to Claude inline formatting is available.
- Phase 3 planning should include a research step to enumerate Tabular Editor BestPracticeRules catalogue for `knowledge/audit-rules.md`.
