# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Never write a line of DAX until the business question, data model state, and existing measures are understood
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Skill Core + Escalation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Skill Core + Escalation)
Plan: 2 of 2 completed in Phase 1
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Completed plan 01-02 (acceptance test scenarios, human verification approved)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~20 min
- Total execution time: ~40 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-skill-core-escalation | 2 | ~40 min | ~20 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (SKILL.md v4.0 rewrite), 01-02 (acceptance scenarios)
- Trend: On track

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Phase 02-context-aware-dax P03 | 1 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-context-aware-dax P02 | 2 | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 02-context-aware-dax P01 | 2 | 1 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 02-context-aware-dax P05 | 15 | 2 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Model after GSD structure — user identified GSD as reference for quality
- [Init]: Progressive friction replaces upfront interrogation — core value inversion from v1
- [01-01]: Solve-first catch-all routing via `*` wildcard in SKILL.md routing table
- [01-01]: Escalation uses gap-type targeting (one question per identified gap, not a full checklist)
- [01-02]: Acceptance test scenarios structured as step tables for ease of manual execution
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: comment asks table-only; error asks table+columns because column names sharpen Category A/C diagnosis
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Step 0.5 placed after ## Instructions header and before Step 1 in both comment and error files
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: format.md gets non-blocking Step 0.5 variant — analyst can skip context question without halting formatting
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Step 0.5 skips the question when ## Model Context already present in .pbi-context.md — prevents redundant re-asking across commands
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Step 0.5 is universal (paste + file mode) — old Step 2 was PBIP_MODE=file only
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Duplication check (Step 2) is always-on — fires before every generation regardless of context state
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Filter-sensitive keyword list includes both DAX function names and natural language phrases for maximum coverage
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Phase 2 acceptance scenarios organized by behavior group (4 groups) matching requirement boundaries for traceability
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Measures gate fires only on analyst completion signal -- never after each /pbi new call
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Gate blocks session close when business question check returns no -- prompts to continue generating
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Measures gate fires only on analyst completion signal -- never after each /pbi new call
- [Phase 02-context-aware-dax]: Gate blocks session close when business question check returns no -- prompts to continue generating
