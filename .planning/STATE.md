# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14 after v1.1 milestone start)

**Core value:** Never block a data analyst — solve immediately, interrogate only when stuck or asked
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Context Field Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 4 (Context Field Fixes)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-14 — v1.1 roadmap created, Phase 3 is next

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7 (across v1.0)
- Average duration: ~10 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~70 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-skill-core-escalation | 2 | ~20 min |
| 02-context-aware-dax | 5 | ~6 min |
| Phase 03-context-field-fixes P01 | 1 | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 03-context-field-fixes P02 | 68s | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Solve-first (progressive friction) over interrogation-first — correct inversion for daily-use co-pilot
- Targeted escalation: one question per identified gap type
- `*` wildcard catch-all in routing: no empty-args bounce for any DAX request
- Step 0.5 placement: after `## Instructions`, before Step 1
- Skip Step 0.5 when `## Model Context` already present in session context
- Duplication check always-on (not opt-in)
- Filter-sensitive keyword list includes natural language phrases (not just DAX function names)
- Measures gate fires only on analyst completion signal (end-of-session review, not per-measure)
- [Phase 03-context-field-fixes]: Use explicit '- Field:' bullet syntax in Last Command instructions to prevent Claude from using wrong field names (Entity: vs Measure:)
- [Phase 03-context-field-fixes]: Fold Rules applied and Flags raised into Outcome field value to eliminate non-schema fields from ## Last Command in optimise.md
- [Phase 03-context-field-fixes]: diff.md and commit.md Step 5 use explicit four-line Last Command format — Measure: field contains parsed measure names instead of (git operation) placeholder

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None (tech debt from v1.0 is now captured as Phase 3 requirements DEBT-01/02/03).
