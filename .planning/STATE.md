# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** A BI analyst can drop into `/pbi` at any point in their workflow and get expert-level help — DAX, model auditing, error recovery, version control — without leaving Claude.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Paste-in DAX Commands

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Paste-in DAX Commands)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — Roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Slash command architecture (like GSD): analyst knows exactly what command to reach for; smart routing for bare `/pbi`
- Support both file-edit and paste-in modes: PBIP reload pain point means paste-ready output is often more practical
- v1 focuses on DAX + model layer, not visuals: highest-value pain points are measure quality and model health
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: pbi-load is complete for Phase 1 — informs analysts that PBIP context loading arrives in Phase 2; all placeholder skills use disable-model-invocation: true
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Reasoning skills use model: sonnet; pbi-load uses model: haiku; all use relative .pbi-context.md path for portability
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: tail -80 cap on context injection prevents history bloat in .pbi-context.md bash injection
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Complexity classification inferred from DAX function patterns, not analyst-declared — zero-setup UX preserved
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Read-then-Write enforced for .pbi-context.md updates (not bash append) to prevent malformed state
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Comment rules focus on business logic (why/what) not DAX mechanics — avoids noise from line-by-line syntax translation
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Description Field capped at 300 chars with no markdown and no DAX function names — matches Power BI tooltip display constraints
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: tail -100 used for pbi-error session context injection — error recovery benefits from more history than DAX commands (tail -80)
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Analyst-Reported Failures is analyst-managed only — pbi-error skill does not auto-write to that section to avoid false positives
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Iterator-over-measure-reference is flagged only, never auto-rewritten — context transition semantics must be manually verified before refactoring
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: CRITICAL GUARD (Step 3) is positioned before rule application (Step 4) — order is load-bearing for correctness
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: Rationale depth scales with inferred complexity: simple=one sentence, advanced=full paragraph explaining engine-level mechanism
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: DAX Formatter JSON endpoint /api/daxformatter/dax returns 404 — legacy form-POST confirmed working; skill uses legacy endpoint with HTML strip pipeline
- [Phase 01-paste-in-dax-commands]: API_FAIL fallback text locked: '_DAX Formatter API unavailable — formatted inline by Claude_'

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- DAX Formatter API endpoint path is MEDIUM confidence — needs empirical verification with a test `curl` call before wiring into `/pbi:format`. Fallback to Claude inline formatting is available.
- Phase 3 planning should include a research step to enumerate Tabular Editor BestPracticeRules catalogue for `knowledge/audit-rules.md`.
