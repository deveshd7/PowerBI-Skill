## Instructions

### Step 0 — Check PBIP and git state

**If PBIP_MODE=paste:** output exactly this message and stop:

> No PBIP project found. Run /pbi diff from a directory containing .SemanticModel/.

**If GIT=no:** output exactly this message and stop:

> No git repo found. Run /pbi commit to initialise one.

**If GIT=yes and HAS_COMMITS=no:** proceed to Step 1 with the note that this is an empty repo — treat all .SemanticModel/ files as new additions. In Step 2, use `git status --porcelain ".SemanticModel/" 2>/dev/null` as the diff source instead of `git diff HEAD`.

**Otherwise (GIT=yes and HAS_COMMITS=yes):** proceed to Step 1.

---

### Step 1 — Gitignore hygiene check (silent auto-fix)

Run this bash block to ensure all noise file entries are present in `.gitignore`. Do NOT output any message to the analyst. Silently continue to Step 2.

```bash
grep -qE '^(\*\.abf|cache\.abf)' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo "*.abf" >> .gitignore; grep -q "localSettings.json" .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo "localSettings.json" >> .gitignore; grep -q ".pbi-context.md" .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo ".pbi-context.md" >> .gitignore; grep -q "SecurityBindings" .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo "SecurityBindings" >> .gitignore; echo "GITIGNORE_OK"
```

---

### Step 2 — Get diff output

Based on PBIP_FORMAT, run the appropriate scoped diff command:

**If PBIP_FORMAT=tmdl and HAS_COMMITS=yes:**
```bash
git diff HEAD -- ".SemanticModel/definition/tables/" ".SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl" 2>/dev/null
```

**If PBIP_FORMAT=tmsl and HAS_COMMITS=yes:**
```bash
git diff HEAD -- ".SemanticModel/model.bim" 2>/dev/null
```

**If HAS_COMMITS=no (empty repo fallback):**
```bash
git status --porcelain ".SemanticModel/" 2>/dev/null
```

Capture the full output text for parsing in Step 3.

If the diff output is empty, skip Step 3 and go directly to Step 4 with zero changes in all categories.

---

### Step 3 — Parse diff into business-language change counts

Apply these parsing rules to the diff text captured in Step 2. Build an internal change list — do not output it yet.

**CRITICAL: Only process lines starting with `+` (not `+++`) or `-` (not `---`). Ignore context lines (lines with a space prefix) and hunk headers (`@@`). Ignore file header lines (`--- a/...` and `+++ b/...`).**

#### TMDL parsing rules (when PBIP_FORMAT=tmdl)

**Measures:**
- A measure is ADDED if a `+ measure Name =` line appears WITHOUT a corresponding `- measure Name =` line in the same file's diff.
- A measure is REMOVED if a `- measure Name =` line appears WITHOUT a corresponding `+ measure Name =` line.
- A measure is MODIFIED if BOTH appear for the same name, OR if lines inside a measure block changed but the measure declaration line is unchanged.
- **Extract measure name:** text between `measure ` and ` =`; strip single quotes.
- **Extract table name:** from the file path — `tables/TableName.tmdl` → `TableName`.

**Relationships:**
- RELATIONSHIP ADDED: a `+ relationship ` line appears.
- RELATIONSHIP REMOVED: a `- relationship ` line appears.

**Tables:**
- TABLE ADDED: a `+ table ` line appears in a file path not previously seen in the diff.
- TABLE REMOVED: a `- table ` line appears.

**Model property changes (metadata-only):**
- If only `formatString`, `displayFolder`, or `///` description lines changed inside a measure block — classify as a MODEL PROPERTY UPDATE.

#### TMSL parsing rules (when PBIP_FORMAT=tmsl)

Parse the diff output from model.bim:
- Identify measure object boundaries by scanning for `"name":` fields inside a `"measures":` array context.
- Group all `+` and `-` lines between two `"name":` boundaries as belonging to one measure.
- All `+` lines → measure ADDED. All `-` lines → measure REMOVED. Mix → measure MODIFIED.

#### Empty repo fallback parsing (when HAS_COMMITS=no)

Treat all listed `.SemanticModel/` files as NEW additions. Report: "All model files are new (no prior commit)."

---

### Step 4 — Format output

**Omit any category line that has zero changes.** If ALL categories are zero, output the no-changes message only.

```
**Model changes since last commit**

Measures: [N added, N modified, N removed — list names by table]
Relationships: [N added, N removed — list names if available]
Tables/Columns: [N added, N removed]
Model properties: [N metadata updates — list affected measure names]

[If no changes: "No model changes since last commit."]

---
**Next step:** `/pbi commit` to save these changes
```

**Format rules:**
- Names list format: `TableName: +[MeasureName], ~[MeasureName], -[MeasureName]`
- Group all measures for the same table together under that table name
- Omit the "Next step" line if there are no changes

---

### Step 5 — Update .pbi-context.md

Use Read-then-Write to update `.pbi-context.md`:

1. Update `## Last Command` with these four lines in this exact order:
   - Command: /pbi diff
   - Timestamp: [current UTC ISO 8601]
   - Measure: [comma-separated list of changed measure names from Step 3 parse, or "(no measures changed)" if diff showed no measure changes]
   - Outcome: Diff shown — [N] changes
2. Append row to `## Command History`; trim to 20 rows max.
3. Do NOT modify `## Model Context`, `## Analyst-Reported Failures`, or any other sections.
